BACKGROUND: 
Hi I'm Jon, I'm a 27 year-old aspiring software/web developer from Denver Colorado. Thank you for taking the time to check out my repo! I have been have dabbling in web development, cybersecurity, and game dev for the last couple of years, and while this has given me a versatile foundation and understanding of the technology, I haven't built enough skills in any one area to take on a junior role at this time. After taking a break from coding the last few months (due to various personal reasons) I am picking it back up with an aggressive and linear learning path, and the intent of building the skills and portfolio to land a junior dev role reasonably quickly. 

INTRO / DESCRIPTION:
This is an extremely simple meme-generator. It was made following the link below and served as a foundational practice exercise for getting back into web development.

TUTORIAL LINK: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0uU2vELiwA&list=PL9bD98LkBR7P16BndaNtP4x6Wf5Ib85Hm&index=5

FEATURES:
- Generate random memes with a single click.
- Display meme titles and author credits.
- Responsive design with a classic meme aesthetic.

FUTURE OPTIMIZATION: 
Being this was a tutorial and is as basic as it gets, when I have the skills, I'd like to make it into something I can call my own. As of right now I'm thinking an automated meme account. 
- The API provided by the tutorial has an extremely limited selection of memes, so I'd like to find a better API or more likely I'll make my own.
- Create options to sort and filter memes generated and take user input.
- Incorporate ai tools like StableDiffusion and Chatgpt for custom creations.
- Automate posting to social media channels with scheduling options and more.
