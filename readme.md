BACKGROUND: 
Hi I'm Jon, I'm a 27 yearold aspiring software/web developer from Denver Colorado. Thank you for taking the time to check out my repo! I have been have dabbling in web development, cybersecurity, and game dev for the last couple of years, and while this has given me a versatile foundation and understanding of the technology, I haven't built enough skills in any one area to feel competent or confident applying to junior roles. After taking a break from coding the last few months (due to various personal reasons) I am picking it back up with an aggressive and linear learning path, and the intent of building the skills and portfolio to land a junior dev role. 

INTRO / DESCRIPTION:
This is an extremely simple meme-generator! It was made following the link below and served as a foundational practice exercise for getting back into web development!

FEATURES:
- Generate random memes with a single click.
- Display meme titles and author credits.
- Responsive design with a classic meme aesthetic.

FUTURE OPTIMIZATION: 
I think it would be cool to bring this project into the real world using better content and automation across various social media platforms.
- The API's selection of memes is WEAK, so I'd like to find a new one or make my own. This could also allow for more user options / filters which can be creatively incorporated into the UI.
- Incorporating ai tools like StableDiffusion and Chatgpt for custom creations.
- Automatically post to social media channels on a set schedule.
